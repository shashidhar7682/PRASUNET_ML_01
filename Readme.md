# Main README

This is the main README file for my project. It provides an overview of the project and links to sub-readme files. This project is done under the PRASUNET Company internship.

## House Prices Prediction using Linear Regression

This readme provides information about predicting house prices using linear regression. It includes details about the features used in the regression model, such as ground floor area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. Additionally, it covers feature engineering techniques for predicting the total number of bedrooms and total area. For more information, refer to the sub-readme files:

- Readme 1 : Linear Regression using 3 basic features.
- Readme 2: Linear Regression Using Feature Engineering.

## Readme 1

- [Linear-reg-readme 1](linear_reg/Readme.md): Linear Regression using 3 basic features Ground Floor Area, Number Of Bedrooms and Bathrooms (in ground floor).

## Readme 2

- [Linear-reg-readme 2](linear_reg2/Readme.md): Linear Regression Using Feature Engineering to for Total Number of Bedrooms and Total Area.
